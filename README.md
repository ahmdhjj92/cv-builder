# CV Builder
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This repository contains the source code for the online app 'CV Builder' (preliminary name), an app which lets you build your resume/CV by filling easy-to-use forms (an online wizard). The app will then automatically generate a .pdf file or .html file (that offers more printing options). Along the process, the user is offered multiple templates and multiple customizations are allowed.<p>
