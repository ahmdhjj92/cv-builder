# CV Builder
## About

This repository contains the source code for the online app 'CV Builder' (preliminary name), an app which lets you build your resume/CV by filling easy-to-use forms (an online wizard). The app will then automatically generate a .pdf file or .html file (that offers more printing options). Along the process, the user is offered multiple templates and multiple customizations are allowed.

## Code collaboration
The app is written using 'Django' web framework and 'Bootstrap' CSS framework. 
Steps to run the code on your machine:
1. You need to create a Python virtual environment and install django. You can follow the steps from [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment)
2. You need to install project requirements (python packages) inside the virtual environment from *requirements.txt*: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
